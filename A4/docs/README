COMPILATION

the file is comiled from the A4 folder using the following command:

    make


*****
USAGE
*****

The program is run from the A4 folder using the following command:

    ./avlTree



*******
TESTING
*******

The program was tested using the two files in the assets folder.
The proram should work properly for those two files as well as any other files you were to load in.

Inserting nodes manually also workds, as well as removing nodes.
If you load in multiple files it should also work properly.

Some of the code for the removal function could probably be rewritten to be more elegant than the way I've done it
although for the sake of this assignment the code seems to work pretty well.  Many of the functions are reusable as
long as you want to implement an avlTree that uses a frequency counter instead of adding repeated nodes to the tree.
