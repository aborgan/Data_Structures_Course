COMPILATION
***********

The programs are compiled from the A2 folder using the following command:

make

*****
USAGE
*****

To run the carLists program, use the following command:

./carLists

To run the postScript program, use the following command:

./postScript

*******
TESTING
*******

carLists:

	The program will load the file called "list" in the assets folder when opened and will function using that file.
	The program only reads a specific type of formatting for the list file, so if it gets deleted accidently, don't
	try to make a new one, just run the program without a list and the program will make one with the proper format
	when you exit the program.  Trying to make a list with a different format will result in a seg fault. Total income
	is calculated only for each given instance of running the program and is not saved (although it could be easily).

postScrip:

	The program will check for invalid postscript notation as it runs and will exit the program and print an error
	message if it encounters invalid notation.  Here are some values to test:

		12+ is 3.00
		34- is -1.00
		12+34-* is -3.00
		10/ generates an error
		12345++++ is 15.00
