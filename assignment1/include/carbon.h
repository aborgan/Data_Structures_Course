/* carbon
 *
 * This function creates a string "carbon" and then proceeds to print every possible combination of the 6 letters in the 6 positions (6! possibilities)
 * The printing is accomplished using 6 for loops for each position and iterates through every possible combination while ensuring that none of the letters
 * repeat (i.e. "carcon" is not a valid output because there are two "c" characters and no "b" character)
 *
 * In: no input is required for this function
 *
 * Out: The function prints all 720 possible combinations of letters on the screen
 *
 * Error: There should never be an error in this code.
